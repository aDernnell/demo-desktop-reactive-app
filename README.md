# Demo application for the talk "Modern desktop app synced with File System using Tauri"

This demo application showcases how to build a modern desktop app using Tauri that synchronizes its state with the local file system. It demonstrates real-time reactivity between file system changes and the app's UI. It is a practical example for building reactive, cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies and OS integration.

This app serves as the codebase and live demonstration for the following talk: https://adernnell.github.io/talk-desktop-reactive-app/

It is also an example of using my reactive DOM generation library [simple-reactive-dom](https://github.com/aDernnell/simple-reactive-dom) as a alternative to frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.
